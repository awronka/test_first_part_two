##TestFirst JavaScript Overview   


## Assignment

For an introduction to Test-Driven Development, read the first three sections of [The Newbie's Guide to Test-Driven Development](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-newbies-guide-to-test-driven-development--net-13835) ("What is Test-Driven Development?", "How does it work?", and "Great, but how is this better than regular testing?")   

Let's warm up by learning to read tests and write code to match a test's expectations. Read more about the philosophy of Test-First Learning at [TestFirst.org](http://testfirst.org/about#whytestfirstteaching).


## Setup

To start, we need to fork the repository and install `testem`, a Node test-runner that will run your test and code.

1. **Fork** the repository to your account. (If you're taking this assessment through LearnDot, there will be a button for this at the bottom of the page!)
2. Go to your own repositories on GitHub and **clone the TestFirst** repository link. (LearnDot will also provide this link for you)
3. Use the link in the `git clone` then follow the rest of the commands.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/awronka/test_first_part_two.git
$ cd test_first_part_two
$ npm install -g testem
```

## Debugging Methods

The key skill here to practice is how to debug JavaScript inside Chrome. You should become comfortable with these methods:

1.  Using the `console` via `console.log` and `console.dir`
2.  Using `debugger` to step through your JS in the Chrome DevTools

This is a great blog post on the topic:
